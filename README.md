# CS231n
CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

Since I was new to numpy and running through these exercise in a rush, some of them were not my original work.

Set up Notes:
1. Don't install the Anaconda3, use Anacond2. Anaconda3 use Python3.6, having different syntax (e.g. print) compare to 2.7 which the assignment is using
